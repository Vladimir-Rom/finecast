# finecast (under development)

Finecast - is a tool for creating a personalised podcast station with content from:
* other podcasts filtered by some criteria. For example you don't want to see in your podcast application all episodes of some podcast but only these episodes which contain some word (e.g. name of a person you are interested in).
* you can send a link to a youtube video and the soundtrack of that video will appear as an episode of your personalised podcast station
